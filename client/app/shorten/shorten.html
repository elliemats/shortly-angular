<!-- note: in ng-model, this implies that link is an obj, and that is has a url property. ng-model creates the obj and adds the url prop on it for us!
note: we're validation on 'name' and 'type' (this is just looking for http)
note: if shortlyForm is invalid and shortlyForm is dirty (has been modified), apply the css class of error to this input box (will be highlighted in red) -->
